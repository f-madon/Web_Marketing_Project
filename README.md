## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview
Congratulatons! Your applicatons for the data scientst and data analyst positions has been chosen!
A couple of signatures on the contracts and you are officially hired by this well-known retail company.
Now the marketing chief officer is giving you “The speech”:
«As a company conscious of the fast business evoluton of our times, we do understand the need to stay
updated». «We cannot ignore the newest approaches and technological advantages», he continues «and
we must aim for a drastic change of the entire team mind-set». «We want our every-day marketing be
data-driven». «You» he emphasizes «will play an important role in this scenario».
Then, he explain concretely the task he had in mind: «I am expecting you to analyse the data available and
make some proposal of new data-driven strategies for our digital marketing campaigns». «I am always
thinking we need to do more to retain high-value customers» he exclaims «Yes! this is definitely an issue
you must address at first. Analyse the data, wrap the results in a nice presentaton and we will discuss it
with the rest of the team!».
Before he leaves you for his next meeting, he gives the last reminder: «Just one last thing before starting to
crunch the data.. I am expecting graphs and numbers to support your proposals, but remember to be clear
as possible in the arguments you will be presenting. I want that the advantages of these approach will be
clear to everybody in the team».
The project is actually a simulation of a typical request:
- analyse the data,
- exploit the results to define profitable data-driven strategies,
- present the findings in order to persuade about their effectiveness.
